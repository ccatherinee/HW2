Reflection: Reflection: I found the concept of a "widget" very surprising/significant. They are the central class hierarchy in the Flutter framework and have things built into them such as the ListTile widget which can be populated with Icons and Buttons. This was really convenient because it eliminated the need for CSS/HTML whereas in previous iterations of the todo app, we needed to use CSS/HTML and style everything.
